# Information-Retrieval-Systems
Final Project

The boolean model and the newsgroup collection have been implemented. Before running the code, the address of the file where the Newsgroup collection is located must be written to the DIR variable, in particular the file that has other files, which separate the documents by common topics.

A pdf with a general explanation of what we have been programming can be found here.
